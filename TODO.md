- [ ] Intelligent image paths based on where the output file is set relative to input file/files. Basically whenever we create new files the `image.file_name` should be relative or absolute depending on where the image actually is. 
- [ ] stdin/stdout support. This will be nice because piping these files into eachother will help with perforance in data pipelines so we don't have to hit disk until absolutely necessary.
